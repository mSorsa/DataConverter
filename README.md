# Data Converter
A pacakge providing easy-to-use conversions; currently from Json -> Xml and Xml -> Json, more to be added later...
Uses generics and implementations are derived from 
`public abstract class DataConverter<TInType, TOutType>`

This way others can append and create other converters while using a common semantic style.
